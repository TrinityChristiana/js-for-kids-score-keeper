# Score Keeper

## Instructions

Imagine you're playing a game with some friends and you want to keep track of the score. Create an object called `scores`. The keys will be the names of your friends, and the values will be the scores (which will all start at 0). As the players earn points, you must increase their scores. How would you increase a player score in the `scores` object?
